                    <p>
                        We decided to use the Godot Engine, rather than Unity, for many reasons : <br />
                        <br />
                        The first is its lightness. As a game engine, both for the designer and the player,
                        Godot is much lighter than Unity. The result is lighter and, above all, more powerful games.
                        Where a Unity installation takes up several gigabytes of space, a Godot installation takes
                        up only a few hundred megabytes. <br />
                        <br />
                        The second is its design. Although both engines share C# support, 2D and 3D capabilities,
                        and strong community support, their paradigms differ. Whereas Unity's design encourages the
                        creation of "all-powerful", less optimized objects, Godot encourages interaction between objects
                        to avoid redundancy. <br />
                        <br />
                        Last but not least, Godot boasts powerful built-in tools (notably for object animation)
                        that will greatly benefit our project, and which are unrivalled by anything offered by Unity.

                        Rider is a code editor that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It lets you edit, generate,
                        run and debug Unity and .NET Core applications.<br />
                        <br />
                        As we're used to using it at school, it was an obvious choice for our project.

                        GitHub is an open-source version management program. A set of files can be
                        stored there while keeping track of the chronology of modifications made to them.
                        Free accounts are available for open-source projects. <br />
                        <br />
                        To organize our group work, we decided to use GitHub. As we were already used to using Git at school,
                        it didn't take us long to get the hang of it. Above all, we had to understand how branches work.
                        These allow you to isolate your work from other branches while you implement a new feature or simply fix a bug.

                        Aseprite is a charged image editor designed for drawing and animating pixel art.
                        It offers a large range of tools, such as layers, frames and tilemaps, to simplify its use.<br />
                        <br />
                        Aseprite helped us create assets and animations, like logos (for our team and Moonlight Ira),
                        characters, various floors, weapons, dialogue bubbles, etc.

                        Blender is free software for 3D modeling, animation and rendering.
                        It offers various advanced features such as 3D sculpting, texturing and more. <br />
                        <br />
                        For our project, Blender enabled us to model buildings for the futuristic city
                        in which the character moves, as well as trees, billboards, street lamps,
                        etc. All these elements add depth to our game.

                        Ableton Live is a professional software music sequencer for macOS and Windows.
                        Live is a tool for composing and arranging music, but its design and ergonomics are primarily
                        intended for live performance.<br />
                        <br />
                        Here, we've used it to create various music tracks for our project.
